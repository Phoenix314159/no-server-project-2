                      the oceans and began to affect the Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading

                       bodies occurred along with the Sun. In theory, a solar nebula partitions a volume out of a 
                       molecular cloud by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin and flatten into a circumstellar 
                       disk, and then the planets grow out of that disk along with the Sun. A nebula contains gas,
